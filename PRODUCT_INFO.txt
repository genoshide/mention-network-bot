      GENOSHIDE MENTION BOT  |  PREMIUM EDITION v1.0
================================================================

[ OVERVIEW ]
A high-performance, enterprise-grade automation tool designed 
exclusively for Mention Network. Built with advanced AI integration,
security compilation, and remote management capabilities to ensure 
maximum efficiency and account safety.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 1. 🧠 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ENGINE
----------------------------------------------------------------
 > Dual-Core AI Support
   Seamlessly integrates Google Gemini and Groq (Llama 3) models.
   The bot automatically rotates keys to handle API limits.

 > Context-Aware Conversations
   Unlike basic bots, Genoshide understands context. It generates 
   follow-up questions based on previous answers, simulating real 
   human curiosity.

 > Dynamic Persona System (Smart Top-Up)
   - Automatically generates 100+ unique identities.
   - Each account gets a specific name, personality trait (Formal, 
     Slang, Skeptical), and favorite topics.
   - Persistent memory: Accounts keep their personality across restarts.

 > Human Simulation
   Randomized typing delays and natural language patterns to avoid 
   bot detection systems.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 2. 🛡️ SECURITY & PROTECTION
----------------------------------------------------------------
 > Nuitka Compiled Core (.pyd)
   The source logic is compiled into machine code (Binary). 
   It is anti-tamper, anti-decompile, and optimized for speed.

 > HWID License Lock
   Your license is bound to your specific hardware ID. This prevents 
   unauthorized sharing or leaking of the software.

 > Strict Proxy Enforcement
   The bot will refuse to run if "Use Proxy" is enabled but the 
   proxy list is empty. Prevents accidental IP leaks.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 3. ⚡ AUTOMATION & EFFICIENCY
----------------------------------------------------------------
 > Async Multi-Threading
   Run hundreds of accounts simultaneously with minimal RAM/CPU usage.

 > Smart Auto-Sleep & Resume
   - Hits an API Limit? The bot automatically sleeps for 50 minutes.
   - Telegram Control remains ACTIVE during sleep.
   - Auto-resumes operations immediately after the cooldown.

 > Auto-Quest Solver
   Automatically detects and completes daily "Visit" and "Follow" 
   quests to maximize point farming.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 4. 📱 TELEGRAM CONTROL CENTER
